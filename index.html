    <p class="color-paragraph1">So, as I mentioned before, this website is about me. I'm not going to expand on that since I assume if you are on this website, you know who "me" is. I like stuff so I'm making a website about it, in irrational hope that someone besides myself will care.
    also as a side note, I made an effort to make the text PG and not use profanity.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="color-paragraph1">At the time that I'm writing this, the pictures on this website aren't showing up, which means if you're reading this you can't see the pictures. In the mean time, while I get that fixed, I'll tell you a bit about myself, even though you probably already know everything I'm about to tell you.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="color-paragraph0">My name is Pheona Love Archer. I was born on March 6th, 2004, 5:12 AM at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, California. I was 6 pounds 12 ounces. not that any of this is of importance, or something you'll remember. To the date (June 26th, 2017) I am just over 13 1/4 years old. I have lived in 3 settlements, And lived in at least two houses in each one. I have no allergies and I am rarely diagnosed with an illness or anything along those lines, and I've only been to the hospital twice for a major medical procedure; once to get my adnoids taken out, once to get stitches in my forehead for slamming it into the cement rim of a public pool at a hotel in Hawaii. If I missed anything factual, let me know and I will put it in.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="color-paragraph0">I have had seven pets in my life, at least that I can think of right now (not including the varying amounts of fish that have been there for about 8 or 9 years). three dogs, two cats, two birds. I still have both cats at my dad's house. One is Stan, short for Stanyan, and he is about three months old, and Cole, who is about twelve years old. Don't worry, he's got quite a few years ahead of him; He's young in spirit.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="color-paragraph0">Three dogs I said. One named Socks, who I can't remember at all, who I had when I was like one or two. I have no clue what breed he was. We called him Socks because his feet had white fur up to just past his ankle, and the rest of him was black, so he looked like- yeah, you get it. And there was Callie, who I had from 2005 or 2006 to about 2013. She was a beagle mix. And finally Smooth, a white Pitbull. I had her for... I think two or three years? Callie and Smooth were best friends. About when I moved to Three Rivers (A tiny town at the entrance to Sequoia National Park) in 2013, we gave Smooth away to someone (I dont remember who) and Callie to one of my mom's old clients. I also mentioned two birds. One was a pidgeon named Pebbles, who I had when I was one or two, and the other was Earl. I had Earl Recently, but he got startled on a sailboat and he flew away to shore. luckily we werent even that far out.
